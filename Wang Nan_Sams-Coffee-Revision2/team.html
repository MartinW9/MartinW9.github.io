				<p class="col-8">Sam's has an ever-expanding/changing roster of baristas and managers that we depend upon to deliver quality coffee and good vibes; we have lucked out more times than one could imagine when it comes to welcoming terrific people on board.  One of said blessings has been Jennifer Vazquez, who was recently promoted to manager over at 55th and Madison. We sat down with her soon after she took the mantle to reflect on her experience with us thus far, how she has taken to the task of manager, and what she calls her "eccentricities". </p>

				<p class="col-4 ">Coffee captured me at a very early age. Since I was 14 years old I have worked as a roaster, cupper, roastery owner and in 1998 I founded Boot Coffee. My mission: advising roasting companies and coffee producers on quality improvement strategies. Over the years we developed an impressive portfolio of clients, from super-quality specialty start-ups to renowned coffee producing countries. My passion: the Geisha coffee farms I started in Panama and my quest to find the mother-source of Geisha in Ethiopia. My pride: winning first place at the prestigious "Best of Panama" coffee competition (2014).</p>
				
				<p class="col-4 ">From a very early age, my interest in coffee began as my father would bring back coffee from all over the world during his travels. After college I moved to Mali, West Africa for two years focusing on international development work.  Upon returning from Africa I attended graduate school receiving a double masters in Intercultural Studies and Theology. My education in international relations and experience abroad provided the perfect framework for a successful career in the coffee industry. I have been with the Boot Coffee Team as a quality consultant and trainer since 2008.  I am a licensed Q Grader and a Q Grader Instructor, as well as a Certified Instructional Trainer for the Specialty Coffee Association of America. For Boot Coffee Consulting, I specialize in developing unique blends and roast profiles for clients.  I also provide expert training to coffee professionals from around the world.</p>
				
				<p class="col-4 ">I started working at my family's coffee farm (Finca Hartmann) at the age of 16. Since 2008, I have been working with Boot Coffee in Panama, managing the Geisha farms Finca Sophia and Finca La Mula. In Panama I supervise a team of nine Ngobe-Bugle indigenous workers and a larger team of seasonal employees. I take personal pride in motivating my staff to take meticulous care of our precious Geisha trees. Farming at ultra high elevations (1700 to 2100 meters) is a challenging task, which -in the end- is rewarded through the quality in the cup. Over the years I developed a unique specialization in the cultivation of Geisha trees. In 2014 I enjoyed the highlight of my career when Finca La Mula won first place at the prestigious "Best of Panama" competition (2014).</p>

				<p class="col-4 ">I am originally from Central Europe where I studied political science and worked with human rights in Slovakia and the former Yugoslavia. In 2001 I started Green Plantation Coffee, offering single origin coffee in Slovakia. For more than 10 years I have been working, living and writing about coffee. </p>
				
				<p class="col-4 ">I started working at Boot Coffee in 2013. My first job in coffee was in the early 00's at a major coffee retailer that will remain unnamed. Being a Barista fostered my love for customer/client interaction. Over the next decade I shifted my focus to mixology and majored in Philosophy at Jacksonville University in Florida. I am a licensed Q grader and an active member of the Roasters Guild. Being the Lab Manager here at Boot Coffee Consulting comes with the perk of always having cutting edge equipment to utilize for my progression as a coffee roaster and cupper. I am an assistant instructor for our courses with a focus on roasting milestones, sensory analysis, sample roasting, digital roast profiling, and brewing techniques.</p>
