            <!--<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Position</h6>-->
            <p class="card-text">When I was 12 years old, I attended a magic show at the National Arts Centre, called The World Festival of Magic and Witchcraft. The show was so fascinating it quite bewitched me, and I left with an intense desire to learn all I could about magic. I began right away and, over the next few years as I went through high school and university, I continued to be absorbed by the many facets of magic. This fascination developed into a firm resolve to become a professional magician.</p>

            <!--<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Position</h6>-->
            <p class="card-text">My local library was a prime source of books on the subject and I also found catalogues for buying tricks through the mail. I practiced every day until I could put on shows for my family and friends. Before long, I was able to charge the grand fee of $5 a time to entertain at friends' birthday parties. And I reinvested the money I earned into new magic books and tricks. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Since 1987. Even though I attended Carleton University to obtain a degree in industrial design (graduating with distinction), I couldn't envision a career doing anything else but magic. In fact, taking the design course has helped me enormously over the years with the props and illusions I create, especially in my theatre work.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Theatre was the next natural step in my career plan I really enjoy the environment of a theatre and entertaining such a large crowd of people at one time. Also, I have new ideas about the presentation of magic and illusions - combining them with music and dance and creating a dramatic story line, for example. I want to be known all over North America, and theatre performances put my name out further afield geographically. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Doug Henning was always a source of inspiration for me and I followed his career and style of magic avidly when he was alive. I was also very pleased to meet David Copperfield when I was president of the Ottawa Society of Magicians (I joined the International Brotherhood of Magicians in 1987.) </p>

            <p class="card-text">Because I perform full-time - I have no other career - I take magic very seriously and give a great deal of thought to how magic is presented. I enjoy developing new ideas and new approaches - creating illusions that have never been seen before and finding new ways to present them. Because magic is my full-time career, I have to run it as a business, and I pride myself on doing so professionally and with integrity.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I think every magician makes mistakes now and then. The thing is not to let the audience know that you have - and so spoil the magic for them. When you practice as much as I do, you know how to cover up minor mistakes.</p>
